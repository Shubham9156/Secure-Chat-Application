# Secure-Chat-Application
Secure Chatting App using cryptography technology

Creating a secure chat application with end-to-end encryption for secure communication.
Building a secure chat application involves several complex components, including encryption, authentication, user management, and secure communication protocols. Below is a simplified example of a Python chat application using the socket library for communication and the cryptography library for message encryption. Please note that this is a basic example for educational purposes, and building a production-ready secure chat application would require much more comprehensive security measures and features.

This example is a simplified illustration of secure chat, and many features are omitted for simplicity. In a production-level secure chat application, you would need to consider user authentication, user management, message persistence, secure channel establishment, and protection against various security threats, including eavesdropping and message replay attacks. Building a secure chat application is a non-trivial task and often requires a team of security experts and thorough testing.
